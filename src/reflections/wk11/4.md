Has been challenging in the sense that i dont retain information like i used to hehhh. I think stress probably drops your iq a couple points lol :) buuuut i have also learned a lot. I dont think i have any concerns at the moment tbh. I know ill have some once i hit my mystery roadblocks. I plan on managingmy time by gauging my progress and adjust from there.
My fav part has been meeting new people and making friends.
