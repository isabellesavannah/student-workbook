What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Strongly typed constants.unique names that allow you to assign symbolic names to inegral values.
Maybe for like an ID?

How can you modify an Enum?
Right in our models

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
Im guessing that our ids we asign are enums?
