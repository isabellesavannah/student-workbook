What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
- Value: it holds data value within its own memory space, the variables of these data types contain values.
- Reference: Does not store its value directly, it stores the address where the value is being stored
- Pointer: Takes 1 of 2 types,either void or type. Pointer types do not inherit from objects, and no conversions happen.

What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Well theres value which directly holds data and then there reference which just stores the address for the value.


In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types? Emmmm, i guess like holding onto the key and address to my storage unit. I dont store my crap in my home, i keep it accessable in a storage unit.
