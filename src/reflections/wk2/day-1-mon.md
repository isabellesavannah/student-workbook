What is Scope ?
The Scope is either Global or Local. If its local it kind of creates a barrier in which they can be used.
Let = no hoist
Var = hoisting

What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting means that, that element is still able to excecute outside of their local scope.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Let is most common and is local, if you use let inside of a function it will only be used within that function

Var is used globally and mostly used outside of functions (at the top of you js code) as to be able to be called within functions

Conts stays constand and never reassigns value, aslo stays local
