Q: What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
A: 1: Ask Mick for help.
   2: Start somewhere and small to break up a seemingly overwhelming project. Even complex/large sites have small sections that ultimately create the entire site and function   

Q: Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
A: https://getbootstrap.com/; https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp; 

Q: How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
A: Personally speaking, i judge a business' legitimacy when browsing based solely on their site. A messy/unflattering site can be very offputing, and come off as a scam and defer otherwise would be business.
   Simply having professional site, with an easy to navigate layout can go a long way. Aesthetically simple sites goes further than a clutter of info/pics/etc
