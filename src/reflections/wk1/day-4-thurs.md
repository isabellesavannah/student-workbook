Q: What is the purpose of wire-framing?
A: Gives the developer a good visual of what to make starting with the homepage then building off the different input/buttons. Without, I imagine would be like putting together a puzzle with a discription enlou of a picture.

Q: What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
A: Hmmm, my educated guess would be homepage > layout > buttons/input > color scheme
   then you can wire each button to a new page and build on and so forth

Q: Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
A: Yeth, personally i think it would be worth it. For myself because i am a very visual person so it gives me a good base to build towards.
   As a team, everyperson has their own style so the feng shui could get very messy without a solid goal.
   And for clients, absolutely. Sites aint cheap so i imagine they would like it to reflect their vision before 100hrs go into their site.
   Retrospectively mock ups may take up some time, but sites take much longer. Best to start out on the right foot rather than trying to wing it on a time consuming proj.
